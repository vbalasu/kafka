This is a library of Python utility scripts that performs the most common operations on a Kafka cluster, including:

1. [List topics](list_topics.py)
2. [Create topic](create_topic.py)
3. [Produce](produce.py)
4. [Consume](consume.py)

Before running these scripts, please be sure to create a `.env` file with the following environment variables: `BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`, `TOPIC_NAME`
